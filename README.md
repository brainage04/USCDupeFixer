# USC Dupe Fixer
The purpose of this program is to remove duplicate songs from (USC)[https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone] between different versions of SOUND VOLTEX, only keeping the most recent version of each difficulty.

This guide assumes that you have downloaded (all six SOUND VOLTEX song packs)[https://oniichan.wtf/help/songs.html].
You will also need to have Python 3.12 installed on your machine in order to run the `main.py` file.
